# Drought Indices and Formulations

## Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI)
The SPI was calculated to quantify precipitation anomalies over a specified
time scale, using the following formulation:

SPI = (X − μ) / σ

where:
• X is the observed precipitation
• μ is the long-term mean precipitation
• σ is the standard deviation

## Soil Moisture Index (SMI)
The SMI was derived to represent relative soil moisture conditions and is
defined as:

SMI = (SM − SM_min) / (SM_max − SM_min)

where:
• SM is the observed soil moisture
• SM_min and SM_max represent minimum and maximum soil moisture values

## Composite Drought Risk Index
A composite drought risk index was generated using a weighted overlay
approach:

DRI = Σ (wᵢ × Iᵢ)

where:
• Iᵢ represents the standardised drought indicators
• wᵢ denotes the relative weights assigned to each indicator
