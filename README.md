# GIS-Based Drought Risk Analysis | Cloud-based open-source approach for drought risk assessment
*MSc Dissertation Case Study: Southeast Asia*

## Study Context
This research was conducted as part of an MSc in Geospatial Science at RMIT University
and focuses on GIS-based drought risk assessment using spatial analysis and remote
sensing techniques.

## Abstract
This research developed a reproducible, cloud-based open-source framework for
drought risk assessment and applied it across the Southeast Asian region. Key methods
include deriving drought-related parameters using the Google Earth Engine (GEE)
platform; calculating three risk components: Drought Hazard Index (DHI), Drought
Exposure Index (DEI) and Drought Vulnerability Index (DVI); and constructing a composite
Drought Risk Index (DRI) using GIS. The analysis incorporated the Standardized
Precipitation Index (SPI), Vegetation Health Index (VHI), Soil Moisture Index (SMI), Palmer
Drought Severity Index (PDSI), land use/land cover (LULC), slope, elevation, and
population density. An equal-weighted overlay technique was applied to generate DHI,
DEI, DVI, and the composite DRI. Drought risk was assessed for the years 2015 and 2020.
Results indicated higher drought risk in mainland regions compared to island regions in
both years, while greater drought severity was observed in 2015 than in 2020. Thailand
exhibited the highest drought risk among mainland countries, while among island
nations, the Philippines showed the highest severity and Brunei the lowest impact. SPI,
SMI, VHI, and LULC contributed most significantly to regional drought risk, with
agricultural areas consistently exhibiting higher vulnerability. VHI and SMI showed strong
associations with other parameters. The proposed framework is adaptable for drought
monitoring in other regions and can support policymakers in understanding drought
drivers and informing mitigation strategies at global and regional scales.

## Research Aims
The primary aims of this research were to:
• Develop a conceptual and methodological framework for assessing drought
indicators and indices;
• Derive drought-related parameters using the Google Earth Engine platform;
• Calculate the hazard, exposure, and vulnerability indicators and construct
a composite Drought Risk Index for the Southeast Asian region;
• Examine relationships among the indicators and analyse the statistical
distribution of drought.

## Methodological Framework
• Remote sensing and climatic datasets were acquired and preprocessed using
  Google Earth Engine to support large-scale spatiotemporal analysis.

• Key drought-related indicators were derived from environmental and climate variables.

• All indicators were integrated and analysed within desktop GIS environments,
  including ArcGIS Pro and QGIS.

• Indicators were standardised and weighted according to their relative contribution
  to drought risk.

• A GIS-based weighted overlay approach was applied to generate a composite drought
  risk index.

• The resulting index was spatially classified and mapped to identify drought risk
  patterns and vulnerable regions.

## Key Outputs
• A GIS-based drought risk index integrating multiple climatic and environmental
  indicators.

• Spatial drought risk maps illustrating the distribution of low, moderate, and high
  drought risk across the study area.

• Classification of drought-prone regions to identify spatial patterns of vulnerability.

• Thematic maps designed to support environmental assessment, planning, and resource
  management.

• A transferable geospatial framework that can be adapted for drought risk assessment
  in other regions.
